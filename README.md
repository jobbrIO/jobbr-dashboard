# Jobbr Dashboard [![Develop build status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/Jobbr/jobbr-dashboard/develop.svg?label=develop)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Jobbr/jobbr-dashboard)

This is a storage provider implementation for the [Jobbr .NET JobServer](http://www.jobbr.io) to store artefacts related from job runs on the filesystem in a folder of your choice. 
The Jobbr main repository can be found on [JobbrIO/jobbr-server](https://github.com/jobbrIO).

## Installation

First of all you'll need a working jobserver by using the usual builder as shown in the demos ([jobbrIO/demo](https://github.com/jobbrIO/demo)). In addition to that you'll need to install the NuGet Package for this extension.

### NuGet

```powershell
Install-Package Jobbr.Dashboard
```

### Configuration

Since you already have a configured server, the registration of the provider is quite easy. See Example below. The dashboard requires the [jobbr-webapi](https://github.com/jobbrIO/jobbr-webapi) component to be installed.

```c#
using Jobbr.Dashboard

/* ... */

var builder = new JobbrBuilder();

const string baseAddress = "http://localhost:1337/";

jobbrBuilder.AddWebApi(config => config.BackendAddress = $"{baseAddress}api"); // you must host it under /api same-origin (in future, this will be configurable)

jobbrBuilder.AddDashboard(config => config.BackendAddress = $"{baseAddress}");

server.Start();
```
